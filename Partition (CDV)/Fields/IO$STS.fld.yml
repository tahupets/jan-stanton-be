      %{Description\:  Field IO$STS is a standard LANSA field. It is set by
          any input or output command such as FETCH or INSERT. The value
          returned in IO$STS indicates the success or failure of the I/O
          operation. IO$STS may contain any of the following values after
          an I/O command has been executed :
      
                   %Value in\
                   %{IO$STS\  %{Description\
      
                       OK       Command completed normally. No errors found.
      
                       NR       No record found matching key or condition specified
      
                       EF       End of file reached when reading file.
      
                       BF       Begining of file found when reading file backwards.
      
                       VE       Validation error detected in data supplied
                                for update, insert or delete operation.
      
                       ER       Fatal I/O error detected, function cannot
                                continue at all.
      
      %{Comments\:  IO$STS can be used in IF commands just like any other
          field. For example the following code is commonly used to issue an
          error message :
      
                FETCH   FIELDS(#LIST) FROM_FILE(INVOICES) WITH_KEY(#INVNUM)
                IF      COND('#IO$STS = NR')
                MESSAGE TEXT('Invoice not found, check number and re-enter')
                ENDIF
      
          Note that field IO$STS is updated during the FETCH command and
          thus cannot be sensibly tested until after it has been completed.
      
      %{Warning\:  IO$STS is a standard LANSA field. The type and length of IO$STS
          field should@NEVER\be modified in any way.
